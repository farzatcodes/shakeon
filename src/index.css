### **Step 5: Add the Landing Page Code**
1. Open `src/App.jsx`.
2. Delete everything inside this file.
3. Paste the **entire React code** I generated for you in the previous response into this file.

**Note:** If the code I gave you exports the component as `ShakeonLanding`, ensure your `main.jsx` (or `index.js`) is importing it correctly, or simply change the export in `App.jsx` to `export default App;` and rename the function to `App`.

### **Step 6: Run the Site**
Back in your terminal, run:

```bash
npm run dev
